## 🛠 Installation & Setup

To get started, follow the steps below to clone the repository and set up your local environment:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CDAC-PROGRAM-in-college.git
cd CDAC-PROGRAM-in-college
```

### 2. Install Required Tools

Ensure that you have a C/C++ compiler installed. Here's how to get started:

* **Linux**: Install `gcc` and `g++` via `apt` or `yum`.

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install gcc g++
  ```

* **Windows**: Install MinGW or use IDEs like **Code::Blocks** or **DevC++**.

* **macOS**: Install Xcode Command Line Tools.

  ```bash
  xcode-select --install
  ```

### 3. Compile and Run

To compile and run the programs, navigate to the respective directories (`C/` or `CPP/`) and use the following commands:

#### For C Programs:

```bash
gcc program1.c -o program1
./program1
```

#### For C++ Programs:

```bash
g++ program1.cpp -o program1
./program1
```

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Use

Each program in the **C/** and **CPP/** directories represents a standalone solution to a specific problem. Here's an example usage:

### Example: Using `program1.c`

1. Navigate to the C folder:

   ```bash
   cd C/
   ```

2. Compile the program:

   ```bash
   gcc program1.c -o program1
   ```

3. Run the program:

   ```bash
   ./program1
   ```

The program will execute and provide output based on its logic. Follow any on-screen instructions if needed (e.g., input values).
